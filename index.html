    <h3>Breif Introduction about myself</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Imran Ismail, and I'm a passionate software App developer. Just
      after my high school studies, I dreamt to be a software engineer. As
      everyone does, I followed a popular course on the island i.e. Diploma in
      System Designing. There, I have learned my ABCs in the system development
      lifecycle with all the tools and techniques needed to develop an
      application from end to end. Just after my studies, I joined a bank as an
      IT operations officer. In that role, I have learned about IT
      infrastructures and their operations and how to manage them for smooth
      business continuity. Also, the bank offered me a scholarship to follow a
      Degree in Information Systems to extend my expertise in IT to a higher
      level. Subsequently, with that qualification, I got an opportunity to join
      the IT development team in the same bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, I was able to develop many Apps for the same bank, and many other
      institutions using my skills and knowledge. Later on, I expand my capacity
      to project and risk management areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I'm back with my passionate skill of App development with skilled
      with the latest tools and techniques to provide you with the cutting edge
      Apps you need.
